Exchanges that I like to use:

* [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=11870797)  - This one is huge
* [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=1RrsP)
* [Cryptopia](http://www.cryptopia.co.nz)
* [Independent Reserve](https://www.independentreserve.com)  - For changing to/from fiat. Mostly non US I think.  Australia based.

An ICO(?) I've participated in - [SKRAPS](https://dashboard.skraps.io/?ref=f9e7b78dd78f1ddbee5b0564)
