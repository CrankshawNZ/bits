# Crypto currency stuff

Cryptocurrency Exchanges that I like to use:

* [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=11870797) - This one is huge.
* [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=1RrsP) - Newer but growing and its platform coin KCS pays dividends.
* [Independent Reserve](https://www.independentreserve.com)  - For changing to/from fiat. Mostly non US I think.  Australia based.
