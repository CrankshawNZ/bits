#Crypto currency stuff

Cryptocurrency Exchanges that I like to use:

* [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=11870797) - This one is huge.
* [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=1RrsP) - Newer but growing and its platform coin KCS pays dividends.
* [Cryptopia](http://www.cryptopia.co.nz) - Lots of smaller altcoins
* [Independent Reserve](https://www.independentreserve.com)  - For changing to/from fiat. Mostly non US I think.  Australia based.

An ICO(?) I've participated in:

[SKRAPS](https://dashboard.skraps.io/?ref=f9e7b78dd78f1ddbee5b0564) - referal link gives you extra 5% bonus when buying in.
